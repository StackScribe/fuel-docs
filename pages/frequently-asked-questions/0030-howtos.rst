HowTo: Create an XFS disk partition
-----------------------------------

In most cases, Fuel creates the XFS partition for you.  If for some reason you 
need to create it yourself, use this procedure:

.. note:: Replace ``/dev/sdb`` with the appropriate block device you wish to
  configure.

1. Create the partition itself
   ::

     fdisk /dev/sdb
       n(for new)
       p(for partition)
       <enter> (to accept the defaults)
       <enter> (to accept the defaults)
       w(to save changes)


2. Initialize the XFS partition
   ::

     mkfs.xfs -i size=1024 -f /dev/sdb1

3. For a standard swift install, all data drives are mounted directly under 
   /srv/node, so first create the mount point
   ::

     mkdir -p /srv/node/sdb1

4. Finally, add the new partition to fstab so it mounts automatically, then 
   mount all current partitions
   ::

     echo "/dev/sdb1 /srv/node/sdb1 xfs
     noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,logbufs=8 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
     mount -a

HowTo: Redeploy a node from scratch
------------------------------------

Compute and Cinder nodes can be redeployed in both multinode and multinode HA 
configurations. However, controllers cannot be redeployed without compeltely 
redeploying the environment. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Remove the node from your environment in the Fuel UI
2. Deploy Changes
3. Wait for the host to become available as an unallocated node
4. Add the node to the environment with the same role as before
5. Deploy Changes

.. index:: HowTo: Galera Cluster Autorebuild

HowTo: Enable/Disable Galera Cluster Autorebuild Mechanism
----------------------------------------------------------

By default Fuel reassembles Galera cluster automatically without need for any 
user interaction. The OCF script looks for existense of `mysqlprimaryinit`
variable and tries to assemble the cluster in a following way:

  - script checks for variable above and for temporary config file created
    explicitly on deployment stage - if first is present and second missing,
    then script enters autorebuild phase, otherwise it is skipped;

  - script checks for the status of the current node - if it is syncronized
    with quorum, procedure stops, otherwise latest epoch takes place as a
    corosync variable parameter for selected node;

  - sleep for five minutes come in place allowing other nodes to join
    corosync quorum and push their epochs too;

  - for every node in quorum script does comparison of epochs and if there is
    at least one node with higher epoch, skips the rest and starts standalone
    service which will join newly formed cluster later; if there is no higher
    epochs script checks for temporary `mysqlmaster` flag and neither sets it if
    flag does not exists nor falls back to the standalong mode;

  - mysql process launches with empty `gcomm://` string forming a new quorum
    and `mysqlmaster` deletes immediately, other nodes joins in a very short time.


To prevent `autorebuild feature` you should do::

  crm_attribute -t crm_config --name mysqlprimaryinit --delete

To re-enable `autorebuild feature` you should do::
  
  crm_attribute -t crm_config --name mysqlprimaryinit --update done

To try an automated reassemble without reboot if cluster is broken just issue::

  crm resource restart clone_p_mysql

.. index:: HowTo: Troubleshoot Corosync/Pacemaker

How To Troubleshoot Corosync/Pacemaker
--------------------------------------

Pacemaker and Corosync come with several CLI utilities that can help you 
troubleshoot and understand what is going on.

crm - Cluster Resource Manager
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the main pacemaker utility it shows you state of pacemaker cluster. 
Several most popular commands that you can use to understand whether your 
cluster is consistent:

**crm status**

This command shows you the main information about pacemaker cluster and state of 
resources being managed::

  crm(live)# status

  3 Resources configured.

  p_quantum-dhcp-agent (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-dhcp): Started fuel-controller-01
  p_quantum-l3-agent (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-l3): Started fuel-controller-01

**crm(live)# resource**

Here you can enter resource-specific commands::

  crm(live)resource#  status`

  p_quantum-plugin-openvswitch-agent  (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-ovs) Started 
  p_quantum-dhcp-agent   (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-dhcp) Started 
  p_quantum-l3-agent     (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-l3) Started 

**crm(live)resource#  start|restart|stop|cleanup <resource_name>**

These commands allow you to respectively start, stop, and restart resources. 

**cleanup**

The pacemaker cleanup command resets a resource's state on the node if it is
currently in a failed state or due to some unexpected operation, such as some 
side effects of a SysVInit operation on the resource. In such an event, 
pacemaker will manage it by itself, deciding which node will run the resource.

Example::

  3 Resources configured.

  16 Resources configured.

   p_quantum-l3-agent 	(ocf::mirantis:quantum-agent-l3):   	Started controller-03

In this case there were residual OpenStack agent processes that were started by 
pacemaker in case of network failure and cluster partitioning. After the 
restoration of connectivity pacemaker saw these duplicate resources running on 
different nodes. You can let it clean up this situation automatically or, if you 
do not want to wait, cleanup them manually.

.. seealso:: 

  crm interactive help and documentation resources for Pacemaker 
  (e.g. http://doc.opensuse.org/products/draft/SLE-HA/SLE-ha-guide_sd_draft/cha.ha.manual_config.html).

In some network scenarios one can get cluster split into several parts and 
``crm status`` showing something like this::

  On ctrl1
  ============
  ….
  Online: [ ctrl1 ]

  On ctrl2
  ============
  ….
  Online: [ ctrl2 ]

  On ctrl3
  ============
  ….
  Online: [ ctrl3 ]

You can troubleshoot this by checking corosync connectivity between nodes. 
There are several points:

1) Multicast should be enabled in the network, IP address configured as 
   multicast should not be filtered. The mcast port, a single udp port should 
   be accepted on the management network among all controllers

2) Corosync should start after network interfaces are activated.

3) `bindnetaddr` should be located in the management network or at least in 
   the same multicast reachable segment

You can check this in output of ``ip maddr show``:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8
  
   5:  br-mgmt
      link  33:33:00:00:00:01
      link  01:00:5e:00:00:01
      link  33:33:ff:a3:e2:57
      link  01:00:5e:01:01:02
      link  01:00:5e:00:00:12
      inet  224.0.0.18
      inet  239.1.1.2
      inet  224.0.0.1
      inet6 ff02::1:ffa3:e257
      inet6 ff02::1

**corosync-objctl**

This command is used to get/set runtime corosync configuration values including 
status of corosync redundant ring members::

  runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.134245130.ip=r(0) ip(10.107.0.8) 
  runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.134245130.join_count=1
  ...
  runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.201353994.ip=r(0) ip(10.107.0.12) 
  runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.201353994.join_count=1
  runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.201353994.status=joined


If IP of the node is 127.0.0.1 it means that corosync started when only loopback 
interfaces was available and bound to it.

If there is only one IP in members list that means there is corosync connectivity 
issue because the node does not see the other ones. The same stays for the case 
when members list is incomplete.

.. index:: HowTo: Smoke Test HA

How To Smoke Test HA
--------------------

To test if NeutrnoHA is working, simply shut down the node hosting, e.g. 
Neutron agents (either gracefully or hardly). You should see agents start on 
the other node::


  # crm status

  Online: [ fuel-controller-02 fuel-controller-03 fuel-controller-04 fuel-controller-05 ]
  OFFLINE: [ fuel-controller-01 ]

  p_quantum-dhcp-agent (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-dhcp): Started fuel-controller-02
  p_quantum-l3-agent (ocf::pacemaker:quantum-agent-l3): Started fuel-controller-02

and see corresponding Neutron interfaces on the new Neutron node::

  # ip link show

  11: tap7b4ded0e-cb: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc 
  12: qr-829736b7-34: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc 
  13: qg-814b8c84-8f: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc 

You can also check ``ovs-vsctl show output`` to see that all corresponding 
tunnels/bridges/interfaces are created and connected properly::
